// Learn About Functional Programming
// Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT

// Functional programming is about:

// Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

// Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

// Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

// The members of freeCodeCamp happen to love tea.

// In the code editor, the prepareTea and getTea functions are already defined for you. Call the getTea function to get 40 cups of tea for the team, and store them in the tea4TeamFCC variable.

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareTea = () => 'greenTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
let tea4TeamFCC = getTea(40);

// Only change code above this line

// Understand Functional Programming Terminology
// The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.

// With that information, we'll need to revisit the getTea function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify getTea to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes getTea more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.

// But first, let's cover some functional terminology:

// Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

// Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

// The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

// When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

// Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

// Note: The data (the number of cups of tea) is supplied as the last argument. We'll discuss this more in later lessons.
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => 'greenTea';

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => 'blackTea';

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for(let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea,27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea,13);
// Only change code above this line

console.log(
  tea4GreenTeamFCC,
  tea4BlackTeamFCC
);


// Understand the Hazards of Using Imperative Code
// Functional programming is a good habit. It keeps your code easy to manage, and saves you from sneaky bugs. But before we get there, let's look at an imperative approach to programming to highlight where you may have issues.

// In English (and many other languages), the imperative tense is used to give commands. Similarly, an imperative style in programming is one that gives the computer a set of statements to perform a task.

// Often the statements change the state of the program, like updating global variables. A classic example is writing a for loop that gives exact directions to iterate over the indices of an array.

// In contrast, functional programming is a form of declarative programming. You tell the computer what you want done by calling a method or function.

// JavaScript offers many predefined methods that handle common tasks so you don't need to write out how the computer should perform them. For example, instead of using the for loop mentioned above, you could call the map method which handles the details of iterating over an array. This helps to avoid semantic errors, like the "Off By One Errors" that were covered in the Debugging section.

// Consider the scenario: you are browsing the web in your browser, and want to track the tabs you have opened. Let's try to model this using some simple object-oriented code.

// A Window object is made up of tabs, and you usually have more than one Window open. The titles of each open site in each Window object is held in an array. After working in the browser (opening new tabs, merging windows, and closing tabs), you want to print the tabs that are still open. Closed tabs are removed from the array and new tabs (for simplicity) get added to the end of it.

// The code editor shows an implementation of this functionality with functions for tabOpen(), tabClose(), and join(). The array tabs is part of the Window object that stores the name of the open pages.
// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
// tabs is an array of titles of each site open within the window
var Window = function(tabs) {
    this.tabs = tabs; // We keep a record of the array inside the object
  };
  
  // When you join two windows into one window
  Window.prototype.join = function (otherWindow) {
    this.tabs = this.tabs.concat(otherWindow.tabs);
    return this;
  };
  
  // When you open a new tab at the end
  Window.prototype.tabOpen = function (tab) {
    this.tabs.push('new tab'); // Let's open a new tab for now
    return this;
  };
  
  // When you close a tab
  Window.prototype.tabClose = function (index) {
  
    // Only change code below this line
  
    var tabsBeforeIndex = this.tabs.slice(0, index); // Get the tabs before the tab
    var tabsAfterIndex = this.tabs.slice(index + 1); // Get the tabs after the tab
  
    this.tabs = tabsBeforeIndex.concat(tabsAfterIndex); // Join them together
    // Only change code above this line
  
    return this;
   };
  
  // Let's create three browser windows
  var workWindow = new Window(['GMail', 'Inbox', 'Work mail', 'Docs', 'freeCodeCamp']); // Your mailbox, drive, and other work sites
  var socialWindow = new Window(['FB', 'Gitter', 'Reddit', 'Twitter', 'Medium']); // Social sites
  var videoWindow = new Window(['Netflix', 'YouTube', 'Vimeo', 'Vine']); // Entertainment sites
  
  // Now perform the tab opening, closing, and other operations
  var finalTabs = socialWindow
    .tabOpen() // Open a new tab for cat memes
    .join(videoWindow.tabClose(2)) // Close third tab in video window, and join
    .join(workWindow.tabClose(1).tabOpen());
  console.log(finalTabs.tabs);

//   Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming
//   If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the splice call in the tabClose() function. Unfortunately, splice changes the original array it is called on, so the second call to it used a modified array, and gave unexpected results.
  
//   This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.
  
//   One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.
  
//   The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.
  
//   Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.
  
//   Let's try to master this discipline and not alter any variable or object in our code.
  
//   Fill in the code for the function incrementer so it returns the value of the global variable fixedValue increased by one.
 
// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer () {
  // Only change code below this line
  return fixedValue + 1

  // Only change code above this line
}
console.log(fixedValue)

// Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function
// The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.

// We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.

// Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

// There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

// This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

// Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

// Let's update the incrementer function to clearly declare its dependencies.

// Write the incrementer function so it takes an argument, and then returns a result after increasing the value by one.

// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

// Only change code below this line
function incrementer (arg) {
  return arg + 1

  // Only change code above this line
}

// Refactor Global Variables Out of Functions
// So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

// Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. Hint: using something like var newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar.

// Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

// Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

// Rewrite the code so the global array bookList is not changed inside either function. The add function should add the given bookName to the end of the array passed to it and return a new array (list). The remove function should remove the given bookName from the array passed to it.

// Note: Both functions should return an array, and any new parameters should be added before the bookName parameter.

// The global variable
var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

// Change code below this line
function add (list,bookName) {

  return list.concat(bookName);
  
  // Change code above this line
}

// Change code below this line
function remove (list, bookName) {
  var book_index = bookList.indexOf(bookName);
  if (book_index >= 0) {
    let removeBookList = [...list]
    removeBookList.splice(book_index, 1);
    return removeBookList;

    // Change code above this line
    }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');

console.log(newerBookList);


// Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs
// The last several challenges covered a number of useful array and string methods that follow functional programming principles. We've also learned about reduce, which is a powerful method used to reduce problems to simpler forms. From computing averages to sorting, any array operation can be achieved by applying it. Recall that map and filter are special cases of reduce.

// Let's combine what we've learned to solve a practical problem.

// Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled Stop Using Reduce, it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (.../stop-using-reduce). You may have already noticed this on the freeCodeCamp site.

// Fill in the urlSlug function so it converts a string title and returns the hyphenated version for the URL. You can use any of the methods covered in this section, and don't use replace. Here are the requirements:

// The input is a string with spaces and title-cased words

// The output is a string with the spaces between words replaced by a hyphen (-)

// The output should be all lower-cased letters

// The output should not have any spaces
// Only change code below this line
function urlSlug(title) {
  //so i have to lowercase everything and replace all the spaces with - without replace
  return title
    .split(' ')
    .filter(word => {if (word !=' ') return word})
    .join('-')
    .toLowerCase();
  

}
urlSlug(' Winter Is  Coming')
// Only change code above this line

// Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria
// The every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if all values meet the criteria, false if not.

// For example, the following code would check if every element in the numbers array is less than 10:

// var numbers = [1, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11];
// numbers.every(function(currentValue) {
//   return currentValue < 10;
// });
// The every method would return false here.

// Use the every method inside the checkPositive function to check if every element in arr is positive. The function should return a Boolean value.

function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  console.log(arr)
  return arr.every(element => element > 0)

  // Only change code above this line
}
checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);

// Use the some Method to Check that Any Elements in an Array Meet a Criteria
// The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not.

// For example, the following code would check if any element in the numbers array is less than 10:

// var numbers = [10, 50, 8, 220, 110, 11];
// numbers.some(function(currentValue) {
//   return currentValue < 10;
// });
// The some method would return true.

// Use the some method inside the checkPositive function to check if any element in arr is positive. The function should return a Boolean value.

function checkPositive(arr) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return arr.some(element => element > 0)

  // Only change code above this line
}
checkPositive([1, 2, 3, -4, 5]);

Introduction to Currying and Partial Application
The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1.

In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

Here's an example:

function unCurried(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function curried(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  }
}

const curried = x => y => x + y

// curried(1)(2)
// curried(1)(2) would return 3.

// This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when it's available. Here's an example using the curried function in the example above:

// var funcForY = curried(1);
// console.log(funcForY(2)); // 3
// Similarly, partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments. Here's an example:

// function impartial(x, y, z) {
//   return x + y + z;
// }
// var partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
// partialFn(10); // 13
// Fill in the body of the add function so it uses currying to add parameters x, y, and z.

function add(x) {
  // Only change code below this line
    return function(y) {
      return function(z) {
        return x + y + z;
      }
    }
  // Only change code above this line
}
add(10)(20)(30);
